# GeometryRelatedSourceScalingRelation
This is a new source scaling relation incorporating the width-limit effect, a general depth-dependent confining pressured effect and a possible free-surface effect by Bob J.Y. Huang et al., detailed descriptions of the models could be found in article as follows:
